Find eight big shell projects and see how/whether they do tests.
=====

I found projects on GitHub and on SourceForge.

## GitHub

I selected the five "most watched overall" shell projects on GitHub as of
18 September, 2012. They are

1. [robbyrussell](https://github.com/robbyrussell) / [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
2. [nvie](https://github.com/nvie) / [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)
3. [xdissent](https://github.com/xdissent) / [ievms](https://github.com/xdissent/ievms)
4. [sstephenson](https://github.com/sstephenson) / [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)
5. [wayneeseguin](https://github.com/wayneeseguin) / [rvm](https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm) wrote its [own test-runner](https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/blob/master/vboxtest/test/unit/utility_test.sh) 

## Sourceforge

On 18 September 2012, I filtered by "Freshness: Recently updated" and
"Environment: Console/Terminal", sorted by "Most Popular", and went down the
list, recording the first five projects that used shell.

1. [Ubuntuzilla](http://ubuntuzilla.sourceforge.net) doesn't use shell scripts anymore, but they [used to](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/ubuntuzilla/index.php?title=Ubuntuzilla_Shell_Scripts)
2. [Clonezilla](http://clonezilla.org) uses [bash and perl](http://clonezilla.org/downloads/src/)
3. [xCAT](http://xcat.sourceforge.net/)



## More stuff
git-achievements has a [hack](https://github.com/icefox/git-achievements/blob/gh-pages/test/testscript) of a test script.
